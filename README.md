# Introduction 
This github repository shows how to build a finit-state machine in ROS environment based on [SMACH](http://wiki.ros.org/smach/Tutorials) ros-package, and how to build a topological onotology of the wrold, in this small project, Protog√© is used for building the ontology, [ARMOR](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_rds_tutorial) service is used for access and modify the ontology.
#### Environment
 It is a 2D-environmen built up with 4 rooms `R1 R2 R3 R4`, 2 corridors `C1 C2` and one special room `E` used as a waiting room befor filling the map, and a charging station as well. And 7 doors `D1 ... D7`

#### Senario
 We have a survallience robot that moves in a 2D environment. First the robot waits in room **E** untill the whol map  is loaded into the ontology, then the robot keeps moving between the corridors **C1** and **C2** for infinit time. The robot must go to the charging station **E** when its battery is low, otherwise he must visit the **urgent** rooms if any, then goes back to its normal behavior moving between cooridors.

 The software architecture is build by four nodes, list of parameters and two customized messages, each node has a specific task to do:
 1. user_interface
 2. state_machine
 3. battery_controller
 4. armor 
 * List of paramerters
 * List of meesages 
### 1- user_interface 
 This node interact with the user in an infinit loop, allows the user to access and modify the onotology by just entring some specific inputs, then this node call the armor server in the appropriate command. Also this node publish the state of the map in the topic `/battery_state`. It publishes **0** if it is not fully loaded and **1** if it is fully loaded. 
   * The required inputs are: 
     * The type of operation `manipulation, query, utils`
     * The name of operation `ADD, LOAD, ...`
     * The primary_command_spec
     * The secondary_command_spec 
     * The number of arguments 
  
 Then it calls the armor server by this command  
 `client.call(name_of_operation,primary_command_spec,secondary_command_spec,[args[0],args[1],args[2],... args[n]])`
 ### 2- state_machine
 It controlls how the robot changes its state based on the reasoning of the topological ontology, and the battery state of the robot. This node subscribes to two topics `/battery_state` and `/map_state`, and it calls the armor server for updating the loaded ontology.
 ### 3- battery_controller 
 This is a publisher to the topic `/baterry_state`, it publishes different state of the battery `True`or`False` in a specific duration, the durations to be full or low are passed as **parameters**.
 ### 4- armor
 The ARMOR package is an external package used to communicate with the Cluedo OWL ontology, it is a ROS wrapper that helps to make this communication possible. For more information about ARMOR [click here](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_rds_tutorial)
 ### List of parameters 
 It is a **yaml** file that list all the parameters used in this project which are 
 * time_to_stay_in_location defeault value = 1 (s)
 * time_of_one_charge  defeault value = 30 (s)
 * time_of_charging  defeault value = 15 (s)
 * visitedAt_R1  defeault value = 1665579740
 * visitedAt_R2  defeault value = 1665579740
 * visitedAt_R3  defeault value = 1665579740
 * visitedAt_R4  defeault value = 1665579740
 * visitedAt_C1  defeault value = 1665579740
 * visitedAt_C2  defeault value = 1665579740
 * visitedAt_E  defeault value = 1665579740
### List of messages 
* Map_state.msg: `int32 map_state`, carry the state of the map
 * It is 1 if the map is fully loaded 
 * It is 0 if the map is not fully loaded
* Battry_state.msg: `int32 battery_state`, carry the state of the battery
 * It is 1 if the battery is full
 * It is 0 if the battery is low
## State diagram

There are four states in this state diagram, the task of each state is explained below:
1. Filling_Map: The robots keeps waiting in room **E** untill the whole map is loaded, the robot can know if the map is fully loaded by subscribing to the topic `/map_state`. When the map is fully loaded the robot go to `MOVING_IN_CORRIDORS` state trough the transition `move`.
2. Moving in corridors: The robots keeps moving between `C1` and `C2` for infinit time, the robots keep cheking the state of the battery by subscribing to the topic `/battery_state`, if the battery is `low` the robot goes to `CHARGING` state trough the transition `tired`. if the battery is not low, the robot cheks if there is an `urgent` room by quering the `individuals of the class urg`. If there is an urgent room the robot goes to `VISITING_URGENT` state through the transition `urgent`.
3. Visiting_urgent:  First, the robots checks if the battery is low goes to `CHARGING` state, else it checkes it the urgent room is reacheable by quering the object properties of the robot `canReach`, if the room can be reached it visit it and return back to the `MOVING_IN_CORRIDORS` trough the transition `visited`. If the urgent room is not reacheable it goes to `MOVING_IN_CORRIDORS` state through the transition `not_reached`, in this case the robot will change the corridors and visit it again.
4. CHARGING: The robot keeps checking the state of the battery, if it is full it goes to `MOVING_IN_COORIDORS` state the the transition `charged`, otherwise, it stays in the `CHARGING` state.
